    "description": "It may be considered a cheap acoustic guitar, but we found it difficult to find much wrong with the DR-100 for those on a budget. The Epiphone DR-100 produces a tone that you wouldn't expect given the small price tag. Available in a variety of finishes, the build quality outmatches most of the competition in this price bracket.\n\nA select spruce top is accompanied by a mahogany body and neck, the latter of which features a slim taper profile for more comfortable playing, finished off with a rosewood fingerboard. \n\nIn use it's a relatively easy player, and the body has ample resonance. If you're on a very small budget, the Epiphone DR-100 is a no-brainer."
